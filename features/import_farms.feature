Feature: import a set of data

  As an analyst
  So that I can enter legacy data en mass into the database
  I want to be able to import new farms or data in a csv format

Scenario: import from csv
  Given I am on the FarmList home page
#  When I press "browse"
#  When I upload a file
#  When I confirm the dialog box
#  When I press "import_farms"
#  Then I should see "Test Farm CSV"
